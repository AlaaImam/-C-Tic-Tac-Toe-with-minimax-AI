# C Tic-Tac-Toe-with-minimax-AI by (Alaa Imam, Ismail Mohamed and Ahmed Kamal)
This is me and my colleagues' project for the Applied Programming course in the Arab Academy for Science and Technology.
This is a full Tic-Tac-Toe game using C code that contains 3 AI difficulties with the hardest one having been created using the minimax algorithm, as well as a two-player mode.
The game also contains graphics and music/sfx of our creation.
The music wav files couldn't be uploaded to github due to their large file sizes, so instead you can download them from here:

All the code for the game is available and can be modified: "main.cpp" for the main menu code and "easyai.cpp" "mediumai.cpp" "hardai.cpp" and "twoplayers.cpp" each with its respective code. 
Run the main.exe file to launch the game.
Enjoy!
