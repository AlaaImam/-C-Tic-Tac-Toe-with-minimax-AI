# C Tic-Tac-Toe-with-minimax-AI by (Alaa Imam, Ismail Mohamed and Ahmed Kamal)
This is me and my colleagues' project for the Applied Programming course in the Arab Academy for Science and Technology.
This is a full Tic-Tac-Toe game using C code that contains 3 AI difficulties with the hardest one having been create using the minimax algorithm as well as a two-player mode.
The game also contains graphics and music/sfx of our creation.
The music wav files couldn't be uploaded to github due to their large file sizes, so instead you can download them from here:
